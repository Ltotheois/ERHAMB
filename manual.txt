   A. Using Erham
   --------------
 
   The ERHAM executable can be started in MS-DOS or by double-clicking the file
   icon in the folder where it is located (Windows95 or higher). A DOS window
   opens and asks for the names of input and output files. Enter the name (up
   to 20 characters) and hit Return.
 
   A version of ERHAM that is compatible with CAAARS 4.0 (I. R. Medvedev et al,
   (J. Mol. Struct. 742 (2005) 229-236) is currently tested. Contact the author
   (gronerp@umkc.edu) for details. 
 
   All input/output files of both versions must be or are text (ASCII) files but
   do not need the .txt extension. All input files  must be in the same folder/
   directory as the executable code. The output files will be placed in the same
   folder. The name of the output files are not protected: an existing file with
   the same name will be overwritten. The prediction routine opens two scratch
   files to store temporary information. They should disappear from the
   directories on normal termination of the program.
 
   Least-squares fitting and predictions:
   The least-squares fit is performed if the number of iterations is positive,
   at least one spectroscopic parameter is declared a variable, and observed
   transitions with non-zero weights are provided. (The program does not compare
   the number of variables with the number of non-zero weight frequencies.
   However, an error message is generated by the Singular Value Decomposition
   subroutine.)
   Predictions are made after (if any) least-squares fit if JMAX >= JMIN
   (Input 4) and at least 1 symmetry block is defined (Input 6). However, no
   predictions will be printed if FMX < FMN, THRES is too large (Input 4) or all
   dipole components (Input 2) are zero. The parameters marked by *** are only
   relevant for the predictions. They have to be entered anyway because of the
   free-format input. The partition function is calculated with the predictions,
   but only if JMIN = 0 and only up to JMAX (see also Section F).

   C. Input in general
   -------------------
 
   ERHAM performs several tests on many input variables. This process often
   results in error messages; in other instances, incompatible input is simply
   ignored. A very important parameter is ISCD (input 2). Acceptable values for
   many variables depend on it. Some input incompatible with ISCD (e.g. non-zero
   ALPHA1, ALPHA2 for ISCD=-1,-2) is ignored or overwritten. Also the allowed
   combinations of IQ1, IQ2 (input 5), IS1, IS2 (input 6, 7) depend on ISCD. A
   comparison of the input file with print of the input data in the output file
   shows the overwrites by the program.

      comment: the vibrational energy tunneling parameters have
               KAP = 0, JP = 0, KP = 0, MEG = +1
 
      Repeat this input for each parameter you wish to define. Input 5 is
      terminated by entering 0 for each of the variables.

   6. IS1,IS2,ISP1,ISP2
 
  *** IS1,IS2 = symmetry labels of symmetry block
  *** ISP1,ISP2 = spin multiplicity for (sym) and (asym), resp.
 
      For two-rotor molecules with C2 or C2v symmetry, rotational wavefunctions
      are either symmetric w.r.t. the C2 symmetry axis (J=0), or antisymmetric.
      ISP1 and ISP2 refer to the spin multiplicities of the symmetric and anti-
      symmetric rotational wave functions, respectively.   
 
      Repeat this input for each symmetry block you need predictions for. Input
      6 is terminated by entering -1 for IS1 and 0 for the other variables.

      J, NN    = J quantum number and label of energy level of lower state
      FREQ     = frequency of transition (MHz)
      BLE      = coefficient in linear combinations for blends
                 BLE = 0. ==> no blend
                 BLE > 0. ==> transition(s) of blended line
                 BLE < 0. ==> last transition of blended line
                 Only one frequency (the weighted average with weight equal
                 to ABS(BLE)/sum(ABS(BLE)) ) is fit.
 
      ER       = estimated uncertainty of transition (MHz) (its inverse square
                 becomes the weight of the transition in the least-square fit)
                 ER = 0. ==> zero weight in fit for this transition
 
      Repeat this input for each transition. Input 7 is terminated by entering
      -1 for IS1 and 0 for the other variables.
 
      Maximum number of transitions: 8190
 
 
   F. Comment on Output
   --------------------
 
   1. Sometimes, the error message
 
   "0NO CONVERGENCE TOOK PLACE IN COMPUTING EIGENVECTOR xx"
 
   is generated by the diagonalization routine. This is usually not something
   to be worried about. It likely occurs when there are near-degenerate
   eigenvalues. So far, I have not encountered serious problems. But the
   potential for problems is there. Should you suspect such a problem, please
   notify me. Eventually, I might have to switch to a different
   diagonalization routine.
 
   2. At this point, the information in the predictions is not labeled.
   Therefore, the missing information follows here:
 
   For each symmetry block (pair of symmetry labels), the values of the
   rotational energy levels are given for each value of J in increasing order
   (in MHz). Then the following information is printed for the R- and Q-
   transitions:
 
   - J', N', J", N",
   - frequency,
   - spin weight,
   - line strengths (S) for the mu(a), mu(b) and mu(c) components,
   - the relative intensity (S * mu(x)^2 * spin weight * Boltzmann factor) * nu
   - one-sigma estimated uncertainty.
 
   All transitions are printed with the frequencies in increasing order with
   the following information:
 
   - symmetry labels, v', J', N', Ka', Kc', v", J", N", Ka", Kc",
     v' and v" refer to the vibrational state labels IV (Input 4)
   - frequency,
   - one-sigma uncertainty,
   - spin weight,
   - line strengths (S) for the mu(a), mu(b) and mu(c) components of the dipole
     moments
   - the relative intensity (S * mu(x)^2 * spin weight * Boltzmann factor) * nu,
   - upper state energy (cm^-1)]
 
   Note, that the Ka, Kc label are based on the (assumed) order of energy levels
   for rigid asymmetric rotors. These labels may be incorrect when serious
   rotational-torsional interactions occur.
 
   Some labels N' or N" are printed as negative numbers in some cases, depending
   on the torsional substate and the presence of symmetry operators. A - sign
   indicates that the eigenfunction (EF) is antisymmetric under a C_2 operation
   which may be a proper C_2 symmetry axis or a C_2 axis perpendicular to a
   proper symmetry plane.
   * For ISCD = 2,-2,-3,-4,-5 in torsional substates with IS1 = IS2 (including
     IS1 = IS2 = 0), - signs mark EFs antisymmetric w.r.t. the proper C_2
     symmetry axis.
   * For ISCD = 3 (IS2 = N1 - IS1 and IS1 = IS2 = 0 substates) and for ISCD = -1
     (IS1 = IS2 = 0 substate), - signs mark EFs antisymmetric w.r.t. the C_2
     axis perpendicular to the symmetry plane.
   * For ISCD = -2, -3 (IS2 = N1 - IS1 substates but not IS1 = IS2 = 0), - signs
     mark EFs antisymmetric w.r.t. the C_2 axis perpendicular to the symmetry
     plane that interchanges the internal rotors.
 
   3. The partition function (sum of states) is calculated during predictions
   but only if JMIN=0 and for levels up to JMAX. Contributions from rotational
   energy levels and torsional substates, but not from excited torsional or
   vibrational states. To assess convergence, two accumulated sums are printed
   for each symmetry block and each J (beginning with J=0, up to JMAX). The
   1st sum is from the levels without the (-) sign mentioned above, the 2nd sum
   (which may be zero) from the levels with this sign. After the blank line
   follow the sums for JMAX adjusted for the lowest energy level. The final
   partition function (up to JMAX) is the sum of all sums in this last row.
 
 
   G. Relative intensity problem
   -----------------------------
 
   Particularly for high J, rotational energy levels may be essentially
   degenerate (Ka- or Kc-degeneracy). If symmetrization and factorization are
   not allowed, the diagonalization routine generates random phase differences
   between the degenerate eigenfunctions. As a result, the (identical) line
   strengths of two degenerate transitions is spread randomly among four
   degenerate transitions, two with the proper Ka,Kc selection rules, and two
   with incorrect selection rules. I don't have an easy solution to the problem.
 
   
   H. Using ERHAM for molecules with one periodic large-amplitude motion
   ---------------------------------------------------------------------
   
   ERHAM can be used for molecules with only one internal rotor.
   Input 2: Use ISCD = -1 or +1
   Use either 
      Input 3a: define the internal rotation parameters
      Input 3b: use 1, .00000001, 0, 0.00005, 0, 0.0005, 0
         (small nonzero values prevent problems in calc. of derived parameters)
      Input 5: IQ2 must be 0
      Input 6: IS2 must be 0 
      Input 7: IS2 must be 0 
   Or 
      Input 3a: use 1, .00000001, 0, 0.00005, 0, 0.0005, 0
         (small nonzero values prevent problems in calc. of derived parameters)
      Input 3b: define the internal rotation parameters
      Input 5: IQ1 must be 0
      Input 6: IS1 must be 0 
      Input 7: IS1 must be 0 
 
 
   I. Comment on symmetry parameter ISCD and direction cosine parameter NC
   -----------------------------------------------------------------------
   
   Less than half of all cases programmed have been used. The following cases
   seem to work (references in parentheses):
 
   ISCD                    NC       Example
   -2  C2v(equivalent)     -1  C2=b   dimethylether, acetone (2,3,8,9)
                           +1  C2=a   3-methyl-1,2-butadiene (4)
   -1  C's(non-equivalent) -1  Cs=ab  ethylmethylether (5), acetone-13C (8)
                           +1         should also work for ethylmethylether
                           -1  Cs=ab  methylcarbamate (one rotor) (7)
    2  C2(equivalent)      -1  C2=b   dimethyldiselenide (6)
    3  Cs(equivalent)      -1  Cs=bc  2-fluoropropane (unpublished)
    1  C'1(non-equivalent) -1         dimethyldiselenide (asym) (6)
                           +1         should also work in these cases
 
   None of the other cases have been tried yet.
 
   When NC = -1, the values used and shown for BETA2 are in fact
   BETA2'  = pi - BETA2
   When NC = +1, the values used and shown for ALPHA2 are in fact
   ALPHA2'  = pi + ALPHA2
 
 
   J. S-reduction Hamiltonian and higher order distortion constants
   ----------------------------------------------------------------
 
   This feature has been tested and used successfully.(10,11)
   An S-reduction Hamiltonian can be used as follows: 
   Enter 0 for the A-reduction parameters deltaK, phiJ, phiJK, phiK. Use the
   tunneling parameter input (Input 5.) to define parameters in the S-reduction:
      d2 : IQ1 = IQ2 = 0, MEG = 1, KAP = 4, JP = KP = 0
      h2 : IQ1 = IQ2 = 0, MEG = 1, KAP = 4, JP = 2, KP = 0
      h1 : IQ1 = IQ2 = 0, MEG = 1, KAP = 6, JP = KP = 0
   Then the parameters printed as DeltaJ, DeltaJK, DeltaK, deltaJ, PhiJ, PhiJK,
   PhiKJ, PhiK and phiJ are in fact DJ, DJK, DK, -dJ, HJ, HJK, HKJ, HK and h1
   instead, respectively.
   Input 5 can also be used to define higher order distortion constants by
   using IQ1 = IQ2 = 0, MEG = 1, and appropriate values for KAP, JP and KP. 
 
 
   K. JPL catalog file
   -------------------
 
   The catalog file in JPL file format is requested using IFPR = 4 (Input 2)
   In this case, additional information is entered interactively during the
   prediction as follows:
   -Respond to prompt 'Enter catalog file name !' by typing: FILECAT 
    FILECAT = name of catalog file (unit 7, up to 20 characters)
   -Respond to prompt 'Enter catalog ID !' by typing: ICATID
    ICATID = catalog ID of molecule
   -Respond to prompt 'Enter Partition function !' by typing: Q
    Q = partition function at selected temperature TEMP (Input 2)
   -Respond to the prompt 'Enter first LOG Intensity Cutoff (LOGSTR0) !' by
    typing: LOGSTR0 (as in catdoc.pdf from JPL web site)
   -Respond to the prompt 'Enter second LOG Intensity Cutoff (LOGSTR1) !' by
    typing: LOGSTR1 (as in catdoc.pdf from JPL web site)
   ERHAM prints a summary of this input just before the list of ordered
   transitions.
   -Please note: The information about degrees of freedom (DR = 3) and quantum
    number format (QNFMT = 1404) is coded directly into the program. The 4th
    quantum numbers for upper and lower state are used to enter the symmetry
    numbers (IS1 & IS2 = 4th QN of upper & lower state, respectively). Q
    calculated by ERHAM is NOT used to calculate the catalog entries (allowing
    adjustment of Q for vibrational contributions).
 
 
   L. Parameter scaling
   --------------------
 
   Sometimes, "error code = 33" is printed by subroutines LSVDB or LSVDF in the
   Singular Value Decomposition, indicating a singular or ill-conditioned normal
   matrix [e.g. when a) parameters are linearly dependent or b) when the ratio
   of largest singular value to smallest singular value exceeds the precision of
   a double precision floating point number (example: rotational and octic CD
   constants when expressed in MHz]. Case b) can be avoided by proper scaling of
   parameters. Scaling factors don't need to be precise, orders of magnitude are
   sufficient. Example: If uncertainties of rotational constants are of the
   order 10^(-3) MHz and the uncertainty of an octic constant or a tunneling
   parameter is of the order 10^(-12) MHz, a scaling factor in the range 10^(-6)
   to 10^(-12) is sufficient.
   Scaling factors need to be entered only for parameters defined through the
   tunneling parameter input (Input 5). They are set by the program for the
   other spectroscopic constants. PS: The entry of quartic and sextic distortion
   constants in kHz and Hz, resp. (as opposed to MHz for rotational constants)
   accomplishes scaling automatically.
